How to make the project
-----------------------

These instructions require GNU Make or another Make clone -- your system likely
has one. Because the index is created using a python script, you also need
python. To create the dvi files type

	make dvis

on the command line inside the directory containing the Makefile. To create the
pdf files similarly type

	make pdfs

To create the book type

	make book

which will create both book.dvi and book.pdf. The command

	make all

will do all of the above at once. After doing this you can copy the dvi/pdf
files to a directory of choice. The command

	make tags

will compile a version of the project with tagged up lemmas, propositions, and
theorems. The resulting dvis and pdfs will be put in the subdirectory tags/tmp.
The command

	make web

creates files book.tex, tags, and my.bib in a target directory WEBDIR; these
files are ment to be parsed by plastex. The command will fail if WEBDIR does
not exist.
